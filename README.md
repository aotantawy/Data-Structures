## Introduction

### What is data structure?

- It's a container for managing and storing data that has a defined internal structure.


### What is an Algorithm?

- It's a well-defined, finite step-by-step process that transforms some input into some output.

### Why data structures and algorithms are so important?

- Being good at data structures and algorithms will enable you to write efficient programs which use computations resources wisely and have the most optimal time complexity.


## Complexity analysis

### What is complexity?

- It's the study of the algorithm behavior when the input size tends to infinity.

### Why complexity is needed?

- The main reason for needing complexity is to compare different algorithms and find which one is better.

### Difference between Omega, Theta, and Big-O notations

| Point | Omega | Theta | Big-O |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
