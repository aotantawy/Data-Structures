## Section 1: Introduction 

### What is data structure?

- it's a container that stores, manipulate & retrieve data based on his internal structure (how he stores data).

### Why are data structures so important?

1. To produce efficient programs which: 
    1. Uses computational resources wisely 
    1. Reduces time and space complexity


> **Note :** in order to produce the most optimal and efficient program you have to choose your data structures wisely based on the situation you are currently in.

### Abstract data types vs Data structures 

- abstract data types define interface for the behavior while data structures define the implementation (how are data will be stored inside memory)
