### What is Data Structure ?

- It's a container which stores data in a well defined structure also it enables us to perform some operations (eg. add, delete, search, ...).  

### Why are Data structures so important?

1. Reduce time and space complexity
1. Therefore, they can produce efficient programs  

> **Note** it's important to choose the right data structure

### Abstract data types

It provides/defines an interface for the behavior
